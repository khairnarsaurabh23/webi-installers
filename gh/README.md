## Cheat Sheet

> `gh` doesn't exist and this text should have been replaced. It doesn't do
> anything, but what it does is useful because it is; everybody knows it.

To run gh:

```bash
gh
```

### Add Baz Highlighting

To run gh with both bar and baz highlighting turned on:

```bash
gh --bar=baz
```
